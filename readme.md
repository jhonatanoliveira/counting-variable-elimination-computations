(Discontinued) Simple Variable Elimination
===========================

A simple implementation of the algorithm [Variable Elimination (VE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_elimination) in [Bayesian networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network).
This implementation supports only discrete variables and proposes a simple file format for describing the Directed acyclic graph (DAG) and the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs).
The primary intention of this implementation is to count computations and find elimination orderings.
Future works inlcude really computing the tables during VE.
